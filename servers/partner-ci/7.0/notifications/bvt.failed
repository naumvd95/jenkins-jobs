Something is wrong with the ISO: it does not pass Build Verification
Test for deployment. We need to fix this ASAP.


Please get into the IRC (#fuel-qa) to check if someone is fixing this already,
or start fixing it yourself.


When you start working on the issue

 - inform others via this mailing list,

 - set build description for the failied build in Jenkins: add link to corresponding
 Launchpad bug or any related info.
